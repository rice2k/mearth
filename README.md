Mearth - Weather on Mars vs Weather on Earth
============================================

A 2013 NASA SpaceApps Challenge comparing the temperature, pressure & wind speed on Mars and tries to match it with somewhere on Earth.

See progress at:
[mearthapp.heroku.com](http://merthapp.heroku.com)

## Data to compare

* Temperature (high on mars, low on earth?)
* Wind speed (comparable)
* Pressure (*1000)
* Radiation (how many hours would I last on mars today)
* Oxygen/Nitrogen level (how much longer would it take plants to grow on mars)
* Webcam image (from the closest match city)

## Technical details

* Build a Ruby on Rails web app to do the calculations and present the data nicely.

## Data feeds from Mars

* Take the Mars weather data feed from the [@MarsWxReport](https://twitter.com/MarsWxReport)
* Raw weather XML feed: [XML](http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/rems_weather.xml)
* Mars Curiosity rover image feeds from: [mars.open-notify.org](http://mars.open-notify.org)

## Data feeds from Earth

* Take an Earth weather feed from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/weather)

## Space Apps Challenge
